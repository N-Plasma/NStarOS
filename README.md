NStarOS Is a project to create a barebones OS for CC: Tweaked that can do all the necesary things you could ever need from it

the OS will have support for most current (V1.116.1 Fabric) features, this includes

A barebones Rednet client (made by me) that shows the ID of the messenger and the text they send (Will become more advanced the more coding i learn)
A Printer system that can print artecales designed in the app
A few small games
